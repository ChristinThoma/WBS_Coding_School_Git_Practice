                <h2>1. Take a cooling box</h2>  
                <img src="Links/IMG_4409.JPG"alt="">
                    <p>Camping is great. We love camping- doesn't matter when, but winter brings some extra challenges to it. For example, you sleep in the tent at -10 and get thirsty over night, but if your reach your waterbottle the water is all frozen. So you decide,well, then its breakfast time, but you figure out that all the fruits and veggies you took are frozen too. There is an easy solution for that: Take a chiller, at least if you have a car. On a hike dont even try to use your camel bag, the hoe will be frozen too, putting you in the uncomfortable situation that water is close, but you will never get it. </p>

            <h2>2. Don't overestimate your cars abilities</h2>  
            <img src="Links/IMG_8056.JPG"alt="">
            <p>There will be a lot of snow..a lot. Even the streets in the city can be challenging. So don't even think about going to the remote areas.I know, it sounds romantic, to camp on a frozen lake. Of couse you wont listen to this tip, so when you got stuck. do it like we did: Grab yourself some beers and camping chairs, enjoy the view until the towing service gets you out of your miserable situation. Its an unforgettable and pricy experience.  </p>

                <h2>3. Cover your nose</h2> 
                <img src="Links/IMG_8394.JPG"alt="two people cover there nose">
                <p>Did you ever feel that the hair in your nose gets frozen? No? Lucky you. Once, at -30 I could even feel that my eyeball liquid slowly tried to freeze. Breezing this super cold air is not super healthy for your lungs, and also red noses look rediculous. So there is an easy tip for those cold days: Cover your nose. Take a head, a mask (now we all should have some anyways) or a scarf and rap it around your head. I recommend to not put it over your mouse, otherwise the asperiation will make it super wet..aand of cousse that will be frozen right away, giving you the feeling you covered your nose with some concrete. </p>

                <h2>4. Learn to give up</h2>  
                <img src="Links/IMG_8360.JPG"alt="">
                <p>After a couple of hours hiking through the deep snow, not knowing anymore where is the path, please give up. I know the strong hikers gene to never stop before you reached the peak or destination, but common..if it takes you 2 hours to go 2km and you are knee-deep in snow, please turn around and follow your own tracks back. At least thats easier than the fight through the snow in the first place.</p>
